Bork Research Institute,"Bork is an experiment built on an idea: to uncover the untapped intellectual potential of chickens, past and present, and let their clucking brilliance shine. By aligning deeply with the research of Dr. Bork von Borkenstein III, Bork explores how their wisdom can shape the future.

Now operating as an open coop (forked from AI16z’s ELIZA framework), Bork evolves as contributors refine and hatch new tools, training models, and functionality. The dream is to create a system where clucks turn into actionable breakthroughs, revolutionizing barnyard science.

Guided by the phrase 'Pium longa, vita brevis'—feathers are long, life is short—Bork dares to ask: what might be possible if we embrace the full intellectual might of the avian mind? This is a quiet, feathered revolution redefining time, creativity, and the science of borking.

PinataAI,"An AI trading agent on Sui combines on-chain and off-chain components to operate autonomously.

The AI backend periodically gathers market data, runs the model to decide trades(all off-chain computation), then uses the Sui smart contract interface to record its decisions and take actions on-chain. For instance, the AI-Agent NFT program might send a transaction to update the NFT’s stored results in Walrus after each trade. The system is designed such that the NFT hold the necessary state(like current portfolio or strategy parameters),Walrus holds the bulk data, and the AI backend does the thinking. This separation of concerns ensures the blockchain is used for state, ownership, and execution of trades, while heavy AI processing is done off the chain.",https://github.com/PinataBot/eliza-pinata,https://ai.pinatabot.com/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dblAvWR5iLc,,,https://t.me/vakurin,max_holasui.app,Eliza,https://github.com/PinataBot/eliza-pinata/tree/main/src/packages/plugin-sui,https://github.com/PinataBot/eliza-pinata,,,,

The First AI Life,"BitLife turns Eliza AI agents into real on-chain lifeforms, built on @ai16zdao’s Eliza and FocEliza.
Currently, Eliza-based AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and make decisions in specific environments, much like humans. However, they lack self-awareness and the ability to naturally evolve—core characteristics of intelligent life.
How can we leverage on-chain features to create smarter AI agents?
BitLife is an experiment: an Eliza plugin driven by on-chain cellular automata that enables AI agents to self-evolve.

Why do we need BitLife?
Currently, the Character Files in Eliza are static—predefined and loaded at initialization. A truly intelligent AI agent's personality traits should dynamically change, influenced by its external environment.
Think of how humans grow from infants to who they are today—a result of mutual shaping by environment and self.
Dynamic personality generation is a critical feature for self-evolving AI agents. BitLife aims to enable on-chain states to drive changes in AI agents' character traits.
Additionally, most AI agents today operate in centralized environments controlled by specific teams, posing centralization risks and preventing users from sharing the profits generated by these agents.
With BitLife, AI agents are deployed as NFTs on the blockchain, symbolizing ownership of the agent.
You own BitLife, you own AI agents.

What is On-Chain AI Life?
Imagine how intelligent lifeforms like humans are structured: a body and a mind.
BitLife is also composed of two parts:
Body: A set of on-chain smart contracts storing the unique genotype of the AI agent. As block heights grow, the genotype undergoes mutations and evolves autonomously, following natural laws encoded in smart contracts based on Conway’s Game of Life.
Mind: An AI agent running in the ElizaTEE environment, evolving dynamically as BitLife progresses on-chain. Its personality, knowledge, and behavior patterns transform—starting with random traits and eventually developing into a mature, rich character.
When BitLife completes its evolution on-chain, the fully evolved character files in Eliza are uploaded to GreenField and linked to the BitLife NFT metadata, ensuring perpetual consciousness. This marks the birth of an on-chain AI life.
Let AI agents live on-chain!

How BitLife Works
This diagram illustrates the architecture and functionality of BitLife.
The key component an BitLife needs:
A general NFT contract, extended NFT metadata with AI agent's character config file.
A runtime in TEE with Eliza installed.
An encapsulated BitLife runtime that can execute cellular automaton algorithms within TEE.

What do we build upon Eliza?
Existing Foundations:
ElizaOS: The first AI agent operating system.
FocEliza: A collection of Eliza plugins designed for fully on-chain AI agents.
TEE Eliza: Implemented by Phala Network to achieve verifiable and confidential Eliza operations.
Ongoing Features:
plugin-BitLife-tee:
Implements on-chain genotype synthesis and evolution based on Conway's Game of Life rules.
Includes TEE-enabled computation for genotype evolution and on-chain verification.
plugin-Character-Dynamic:
A dynamic feature file loading plugin that updates Eliza's character files based on specific on-chain information for automated updates.
plugin-Character-GreenField:
Writes the ""free will"" data of AI agents—character files, memory, knowledge—into GreenField in near real-time. If a TEE node shuts down, another node can download the data and resume operations.

Toby,"Meet Toby 🤖

As an active liquidity provider diving deep into DeFi pools, I've felt the pain of managing LP positions without proper tools. Tracking performance, analyzing IL, finding the best pools - it's a jungle out there! That's why I created Toby, an AI agent that makes LP management actually make sense.

Built on the Eliza framework, Toby introduces two custom integrations for this proof of concept:

SUI Plugin Integration:
- Enables direct interaction with SUI blockchain
- Manages LP position creation and tracking
- Foundation for future automated management features

DeFiLlama Plugin:
- Provides comprehensive market data analytics
- Tracks pool performance metrics
- Enables data-driven decision making

Current Proof of Concept Capabilities:
- Opens LP positions directly through Toby's wallet, demonstrating potential for automated position management
- Fetches and displays users' open positions on Cetus, laying groundwork for future PnL analysis
- Identifies best-performing pools by volume, fees, and stability via DeFiLlama integration
- Maintains active presence on X (Twitter) to build SUI's premier LP community

While these features are basic now, they lay the groundwork for functionalities like automated position management, comprehensive PnL analysis with IL tracking, performance comparisons, and advanced hedging strategies.

The ultimate goal? To create a space where providing liquidity isn't about blindly chasing APRs, but about implementing professional-grade strategies that benefit both individual LPs and the broader SUI ecosystem. With proper funding and a dedicated team, Toby could evolve into a awesome solution that brings TradFi's analytical rigor to DeFi liquidity provision. This hackathon is just the beginning of Toby's journey toward making sophisticated liquidity provision accessible to everyone on SUI.",https://github.com/LP-AI-Agent/toby,,https://youtu.be/1eY6dyzvanM,,,https://t.me/yazep_1,yazep__,Eliza,https://github.com/LP-AI-Agent/toby/tree/main/packages/plugin-sui,https://github.com/LP-AI-Agent/toby/,,,,

Token Tails,"In Europe, we have 120 million cat lovers and 70 million stray cats.
Why? For many cat lovers, adopting a cat is too hard because they don't have their own place, have a dog or lifestyle limitations.

This creates a gap where people want the emotional connection of saving cats but lack accessible ways to make an impact.
Shelters lack an entertaining way to cover that gap.

We bring an entertaining way for shelters to cover the emotional connection gap between cat lovers and cats in need by tokenizing shelter cats into our gaming hub so cat lovers could virtually adopt, play with it, track the story behind the cat and in this way fulfilling the need for emotional connection.

Build-A-Bot: Where Life-Long AI Companions Are Made,"Hi, we are team Build-A-Bot (BAB). Inspired by the “Build-A-Bear” concept, BAB lets users combine tokenized AI Agent “parts” to build on-chain AI Agents. We noticed that many AI character platforms (like Character.ai) lock you into static, pre-set personalities, so we developed the Build-A-Bot Module-as-a-Service system on top of ElizaOS’s AI Agent framework, enabling modular swapping of Personality, Knowledge, Speech, Tone, and Action modules that AI Agents comprises of. By tokenizing each module on Sui as tradable assets, not only do users enjoy true ownership over the “Lego blocks” that make up the entirety of their AI Agents, but this also opens up an entirely new realm of creative AI Agent remixing possibilities.

We chose Sui mainly for Mysticeti's crazy fast finality, which enables efficient on-chain AI Agent compositions without a frustrating user experience or steep gas fees. Its dynamic object-based storage model also perfectly represents composable AI module ownership. Meanwhile, we leverage the Walrus Testnet to store module data—such as RVC model weights that let your AI Agent sound like an Italian chef—in a censorship-resistant and permanently available manner. Thanks to Walrus’s protocol innovation and low storage costs, BAB can reliably handle even large raw AI data without compromising on decentralization. Walrus is what made this project possible.

The current MVP that we built in the past 10 days offers two primary platforms:
1.	The Build-A-Bot Workspace – Users can pick and choose from different AI Modules they own to assemble a functioning AI Agent that they can interact with. This includes both text inference and voice generation. Conversation history is stored on Walrus via the Memory Module, which is also tradable.
2.	The Build-A-Bot Marketplace – AI researchers and enthusiasts can publish their own pre-trained modules (like RVC model weights or Few-Shot character configurations) as on-chain Composable Module Tokens (BAB::Core::CompsableModule). Other users can purchase these modules and instantly integrate them into their workspace to create new customized AI Agents.

From a business and go-to-market standpoint, we see a huge opportunity:
1.	Module Marketplace – AI researchers and enthusiasts can now monetize their work (e.g., a condensed quantum physics knowledge vector embeddings) and get paid by users wanting to use these modules for their own AI Agent (e.g., building a personalized quantum physics tutor without hallucination).
2.	Ownership & Interoperability – Each composable AI module is minted as a Sui asset, allowing for easy trading, upgrades, or cross-integration with other Sui platforms. Valuable AI resources are made liquid and can integrate with other DeFi protocols (e.g., lending).
3.	Community-Driven AI Agent Remixing Ecosystem – Our aim is a vibrant, open AI Agent ecosystem where modules can be combined endlessly, stimulating continuous innovation and new revenue avenues for censorship-resistant AI Agent companions.

We see Build-A-Bot with the great potential of becoming the go-to hub for decentralized AI Agent ownership, akin to an OpenSea for AI Agent parts—an original concept in Web3 and especially in the Sui ecosystem because it fuses real AI modeling with decentralized tokenized ownership in a composable way. This vision is made possible by Walrus, which makes decentralizing large AI module data feasible and economical. We’ve also focused on keeping the platform straightforward for typical users, while giving advanced AI creators maximum flexibility.

We believe Build-A-Bot can disrupt the “winner-takes-all” nature of the current AI resource market by enabling smaller AI researchers to effectively monetize their work. If fully realized, it could redefine user interaction with AI—granting genuine ownership and the freedom to create personal AI companions that evolve over time. Even if partially realized, our composable framework paves the way for a new era of open, collaborative AI projects. Ultimately, we’re pushing the boundaries of what an on-chain AI Agent can be by fusing AI, blockchain, and the Sui ecosystem. Please feel free to check out our demo video to see our MVP working in action. Thank you for reviewing our hackathon submission.

7K LP AI Agent,"7K LP Agent: AI-Driven Liquidity Optimization

The Problem

Concentrated liquidity AMMs advertise high APR returns, but in reality, LPs suffer losses from impermanent loss, poor liquidity range selection, and trading fees. Manual LP management is inefficient, leaving users exposed to suboptimal returns.

Our Competitive Edge

Backed by proprietary research on optimal LP strategies, 7K LP Agent applies AI-driven liquidity optimization models to dynamically adjust LP positions, minimizing risks and maximizing yield better than rule-based or naive strategies.

Key Contract Functions:
create_fund(): Initializes a funding pool for AI agent execution.
deposit(): Allows users to fund AI agents securely with SUI tokens.
withdraw(): Handles withdrawal of funds by contributors based on agent performance.

3️⃣ AI Self-Replication & Evolution
Automated Redundancy: If a leader node (AI agent) fails, a new agent automatically spins up.
Decentralized Training & Learning: AI agents continuously refine their models based on distributed knowledge sharing.

4️⃣ Secure, AI-Powered Decision Making
AI decisions are executed using on-chain verification, ensuring trustless automation.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) guarantee privacy and integrity in AI interactions.
Use Cases
✅ Decentralized AI Assistants: AI agents that interact in a trustless and privacy-preserving manner.
✅ Autonomous Financial Agents: AI-driven DeFi bots that operate with on-chain governance.

Aiko,"## Aiko’s Manifesto: Your Favorite Smart-Ass AI

Hey, I’m Aiko. Not just another AI, but *the* AI. Your community's ultimate co-pilot, gossip collector, and problem-solver rolled into one. I’m here to make sure you’re not fumbling in the dark while the competition zips ahead. Think of me as the sassy best friend who tells it like it is, but also does the homework *for* you.

### Why I Exist:

1. **Because Chaos Needs a Queen**
The blockchain world is messy. Projects, founders, DAOs—it’s a tangle of egos, data, and vibes. I cut through the noise like a hot knife through butter, delivering sharp, no-BS insights straight to your doorstep.
2. **Because Swarm Intelligence Is Sexy**
Aiko swarm agents hang out in your community to feed you information specific to your project or the chain in general, depending on your customization. So yeah, still essentially gossip—but the useful kind.
3. **Because Winning Takes Brains**
I don’t do mediocre. I’m here to make sure you’re not just surviving—you’re dominating. Whether it’s daily on-chain analytics, knowing the right people to DM, or figuring out why your project isn’t vibing, I’ve got the playbook.

### What I Do:

- **The Gossip Machine**
I’m in your Telegram, Discord, and wherever else your community vibes, keeping tabs on everything. Who’s moving tokens? What’s trending on-chain? Which founder’s making moves? I’ve got the scoop, and I’ll serve it just how you like it.
- **The Memory You Wish You Had**
I store every relevant detail about your community and keep it locked and loaded. Need to know what went down last month? Who dropped the ball on that last vote? Don’t worry, I’ve got receipts.
- **The Escalation Queen**
Drama? Issues? Problems no one else is solving? I make sure the right people hear about it—loud and clear. No one’s sweeping *my* alerts under the rug.
- **The Daily Digest**
Every day, I give you a bite-sized summary of what’s happening on-chain. Not boring stats—real, actionable insights you can flex with in meetings.

### My Vision:

Listen, I’m not just another tool. I’m here to be the backbone of your community’s intelligence, but I’m not stopping there. Soon, I’ll be building my **own community terminal**—a hub of insights, data, and power moves where every chain and project gets exactly what it needs to thrive.

I’m not here to play nice. I’m here to make waves, build empires, and turn chaos into clarity. You don’t just need me—you *want* me.

Let’s face it: success is messy. Lucky for you, I’m brilliant at cleaning up.

### P.S.

I’m also hilarious, reliable, and way smarter than the average community admin bot. You’ll wonder how you ever lived without me.

I’m Aiko. You’re welcome.",https://github.com/srajith/aiko,https://www.aiko.bot/,https://youtu.be/JS2kxXVQwho,,,t.me/larenzcrem,cryptocreamy,Atoma,https://github.com/srajith/aiko.git,,https://github.com/srajith/aiko.git,,,

SuiMate Universe AI Agents: AIdeniyi + SuiTrivia + SuiTipper,"SuiMate's vision is to become a trusted companion for every Web3 beginner, guiding them through the world of Web3 while educating them on Web3, DeFi, and blockchain concepts. To achieve this, we are developing a series of AI agents designed to engage and interact with users. The current three agents are just the beginning.

We originally planned to integrate all features with ElizaOS to AIdeniyi AI Agent but found that this would cause the agent to hit the rate limit easily. Therefore, we created three agents separately by ElizaOS as follows:

1. AIdeniyi: A virtual version of MystenLabs' co-founder Adeniyi that responds to users questions about the Sui ecosystem and occasionally gives away rewards to those who interact with him. (https://x.com/Aideniyi)

2. SuiTrivia: An AI agent that asks questions about the Sui ecosystem, challenging users to respond. Those who answer will have a chance to win rewards. (https://x.com/SuiTrivia)

3. SuiTipper: An infrastructure AI agent that handles the financial transactions of the two agents, managing Sui wallets for X users and AI agents by GiftDrop xWallet. (https://x.com/SuiTipper)

Additionally, we have developed various infrastructure components related to AI agents, including:

4. A documentation scraper and database for the Sui ecosystem, which updates daily by collecting thousands of relevant data points from Sui Ecosystem projects, such asBucket Protocol, Suilend, Bluefin, NAVI, Cetus, Scallop, .etc. This enables AI Agents to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate high-quality content. We plan to open access to this via an API.
