Robobo,6,7,8,7,28.00,70%,7.00,Really cool UI. Not a truly new idea but it's adapted to blockchain tech in a way that makes sense. ,Creative Innovation and Novelty,"Judges assess the originality, creativity, novelty, and the innovative potential of the idea. Concepts can gain points for being unique, forward-thinking, ambitious, and distinctly original (either within the Sui ecosystem or the broader web3 space). The justification for the concept can be based on creativity, impact, or innovation rather than strictly on business viability.

Teams are evaluated on the strength and uniqueness of their idea rather than its execution or completion.

A strong score in this category can be achieved by excelling in one or more of these areas. An idea does not need to excel across all aspects to score a 10—it simply needs to demonstrate outstanding creativity or originality in some way. For example, a novel approach to gamified education does not need to have widespread real-world impact to score a 10. Similarly, a groundbreaking decentralized art project does not need immediate practical applications to achieve a high score.


",,,,"- How original is the idea within the context of the tech industry, web3, and the Sui ecosystem?
- How well does the team articulate and understand their concept? Is the explanation clear, concise, and well-structured, or does it feel sprawling or disorganized?
- How thoughtfully crafted is the strategy behind the idea? Is it targeted, ambitious, or well-defined, with a clear direction that the team is pursuing?
- How much consideration has been given to the business viability of the idea as a product or service?
- To what extent does the idea account for its position in the Sui ecosystem? Does it leverage composability, interoperability, or other unique ecosystem strengths?
- What potential social impact could this idea achieve if fully realized? What degree of impact could it have if only partially realized?
- Finally, what is the overall quality and innovation level of the idea?",,,,"0-3 (poor): The idea lacks originality or is poorly explained. There is minimal innovation, no clear creative strategy, or the concept feels derivative. The arguments might be unconvincing or incoherent, with no meaningful connection to the Sui ecosystem or the broader tech industry.

Rockee,6,6,6,8,26.00,65%,6.50,"Not sure what differentiates it from other DeFAI projects doing the same thing, but points for a really cool UI",Technical Functionality and Implementation,"Judges will evaluate the agent's concept and implementation, focusing on the quality of execution, functionality, and overall usability. This category assesses how well the technical aspects of the agent have been implemented, including its performance, design quality, and reliability. While not all factors are required for a top score, exceptional technical execution or a seamless user interaction experience can significantly enhance the score.
The completeness and sophistication of the implementation of the project. How much of the project is implemented? How much of the implementation is correct? How innovative is the usage of Sui features? While functionality and technical correctness are important, an agent with a well-crafted interface or an elegantly designed interaction flow can score highly, even if some technical components are incomplete or experimental.

Atoma Network n8n Community Node Integration,7,7,7,7,28.00,70%,7.00,I could see it competing with other launchpads,Solution complexity and sophistication,"Judges assess the completeness and sophistication of the implementation of the agent. How much of the functionality is implemented? How correct is the implementation? How innovative is the usage of Sui features within the agent?

Teams are judged on the technical implementation of the agent, as distinct from the concept or user experience. While usability and interface design are relevant in other categories, this section focuses on the technical execution. For example, a well-coded agent that effectively leverages Sui’s unique features, such as composability or low latency, would score higher than one with a basic or generic implementation.

Agents should have a roughly complete and correct implementation to achieve a top score, but innovation in using Sui-specific features can further elevate the score. This could include leveraging Sui’s object composability, Move language capabilities, zkSend, dynamic fields, or designing for Sui’s low gas fees, high throughput, and low latency. An agent that goes beyond basic functionality to creatively integrate these features demonstrates strong technical sophistication.",,,,"- How much of the agent’s functionality is completed?
- What is the overall code quality of the implementation?
- How correct and reliable is the implementation? Are there any obvious bugs or errors in the final version?
- How “finished” and maintainable is the agent? Could it be further developed or scaled with ease?
- Has the agent effectively leveraged Sui’s unique features to create capabilities that are only possible on Sui? Examples include object composability, dynamic fields, zkSend, or low-latency/high-throughput design.",,,,"0-3 (poor): A poor technical implementation is absent, completely incorrect, or critically broken. Core agent workflows do not function as intended. There is minimal or no testing, code quality is abysmal, and maintenance is either nonexistent or infeasible."

IVAN AI,5,7,7,8,27.00,68%,6.75,"Not novel but abstration is good, the market needs this",,,,,,,,,,"3-6 (mediocre): A mediocre technical implementation works, but with significant limitations. Core agent functionality exists but may be partially broken or implemented poorly. Some workflows may not function, and the implementation may be overly buggy or lack maintainability. An agent that minimally uses Sui features without innovation, or mimics standard approaches without leveraging Sui’s unique capabilities, falls into this category.

EverionAI,8,7,8,9,32.00,80%,8.00,"True product thinking, this solves an immediate and widespread pain point",,,,,,,,,,"6-9 (good): A good technical implementation works well, with minor or rare bugs. The agent adheres to Sui conventions and best practices, with reasonable code quality and sufficient testing. Testing processes are automated, and the implementation demonstrates signs of maintainability. Clever or innovative use of Sui’s unique features, such as dynamic fields or zkSend, can elevate an otherwise standard implementation to this level.

How relevant is the agent’s functionality in real-world scenarios? How well does it create tangible value for users or ecosystems?

Teams are judged on the agent's ability to provide a practical, scalable, and impactful solution. While technical implementation is considered in other categories, this section focuses on the real-world implications and benefits of the agent. For example, an agent that solves a widespread pain point or offers innovative solutions with clear utility would score higher than one with limited or niche use cases.

Agents should demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem they aim to solve and their broader implications for users or systems. Amplify their real-world relevance can elevate the score.
